# Voice-controlled-robot-using-Arduino-Application-Controlled
The Project objective was to make a Voice Controlled Robot that can be controlled by an app on the Android Platform. The Voice is converted into text by Google voice-to-text technology. The app sends the ‘text’ to the Arduino board using BT module, which is processed by Arduino board and results in Motion of the Robot.
